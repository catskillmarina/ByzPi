The way this works is that a new mysql table is created for timestamps that are
updated whenever a new record in the main etherpad table is inserted. This is
done with mysql triggers, so it only works with mysql as a backend. Then a
clear-old-pads.rb uses the etherpad API to delete pads with old timestamps.

It is recommended that you run the cronjob regularly, at least several times a
day. This is because if you run it irregularly, it was found that deleting large
numbers of pads would cause problems with the server, so its better to remove
smaller batches more regularly.

How to use:

0. In your my.cnf you need something like the following:

[mysqld]
init_connect='SET collation_connection = utf8_general_ci; SET NAMES utf8;'

1. Add the pad_timestamps table to your etherpad-lite database:
mysql> use etherpad-lite
mysql> \. timestamp-mysql.sql

2. Put the ../../templates/pad-ecology/clear-old-pads.erb somewhere useful

3. install the required gems:
# sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems libmysql-ruby1.8
# sudo gem install json

NOTE: there is currently a bug with the current version of the ruby
etherpad-lite API gem. Pad names with non-ascii characters in their names
sometimes throw exceptions and keep things from being cleaned up. The unstable
etherpad-lite gem fixes this issue

4. Get the unstable etherpad-lite gem and put it in the same directory as the
clear-old-pads.rb (dont worry, this is only used for the clear-old-pads.rb
script, not for your main etherpad-lite)

5. edit clear-old-pads.rb to fill out the database password, url and api key

6. Setup a cronjob to run clear-old-pads.rb on a regular basis (maybe once per
hour, like */1)

You can run clear-old-pads.rb with --verbose to see if it works properly.
